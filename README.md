 Three observations or inferences that can be made from the data:
  1. Plotting the boxplot of the top 4 Final Tumor Volumes on teh same axis reveals clearly that Ramicane and Capomulin have a much smaller variation and much smaller Tumor volumes than that of Ceftamin or Infubinol.
  2. Looking at 1 single Mouse from the Capomulin Trials reveals a positive correlation of 0.53, which is decent, but could be better to build more confidence. I would recommend iterating all the Mice from tehe Capomulin study before drawing any conclusions.
  3. Looking at a single sample mouse from the Campomulin trial clearly shows that once the mouse starting taking the drug their tumors rapidly decreased in size, that by day 40 they were already half their volume!
